Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Nice to meet you.

I am a theoretical high energy physicist turned software developer turned engineering manager. I've been in the software industry for over 20 years and have had the opportunity to work with technologies across the full stack.

Currently, I work at [Shopify](https://shopify.com) as the Engineering Manager of the Ruby Infrastructure Team.

Our team is responsible for ensuring that the Ruby language and tooling around it continues to thrive and develop for years to come. For that purpose, we work on making improvements to the Ruby language such as building [a high-performance JIT compiler inside CRuby](https://speed.yjit.org), optimizing [the memory layout of CRuby objects for better performance](https://rubykaigi.org/2021-takeout/presentations/peterzhu2118.html), and implementing [object shapes for simpler and faster ivar access](https://rubykaigi.org/2021-takeout/presentations/chrisgseaton.html).

Since December 2023, I am also on the Board of [Ruby Central](https://rubycentral.org) helping the organization with its OSS and conference efforts.
