Joining us today as our special guest is Ufuk Kayserilioglu, who’s the Engineering Manager of the Ruby Infrastructure Team at Shopify. We’ll hear Ufuk’s story about his pathway to programming and Ruby, we learn more about his job and his team at Shopify, where their project ideas come from, and how they’re very close to production workloads running TruffleRuby. Also, Jason fills us in on something he was blown away by that involves Ufuk and his team with YJIT, and there’s a YJIT Benchmarks dashboard that you should check out.
