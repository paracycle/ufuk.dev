In this episode, Ufuk Kayserilioglu and I discuss the Lean Startup methodology and how it relates to the scientific method and the build, measure, learn loop, how to come up with ideas for businesses, sharpening up a business concept with the Lean Canvas, the real reasons people go to conferences, and how to measure success.
